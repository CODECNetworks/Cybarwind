            <h3>Certified Ethical Hacking Certification</h3>
            <p> A Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) is a trained professional who legally penetrates networks and systems
              to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Unlike malicious hackers, CEHs operate with permission and
              adhere to ethical guidelines. They utilize the same tools and techniques as cybercriminals but with the
              goal of improving security rather than causing harm. CEHs employ various methods such as penetration
              testing, vulnerability assessments, and social engineering to assess the security posture of
              organizations. By simulating real-world cyberattacks, they help businesses identify and mitigate potential
              risks, thereby strengthening their defenses against malicious intrusions.</p>
            <p>To become a Certified Ethical Hacker, individuals typically undergo rigorous training and pass an
              examination to demonstrate their proficiency in ethical hacking techniques and best practices. This
              certification is highly regarded in the cybersecurity industry and is often pursued by professionals
              seeking careers in penetration testing, security analysis, and risk management.</p>

                      <h4>How You Will Engage</h4>
                      <p>The CIEH V12 program helps you develop real-world experience in ethical hacking through the
                        hands-on CIEH practice environment. CIEH Engage equips you with the skills to prove that you
                        have what it takes to be a great ethical hacker. Your security assessment objectives will be
                        presented as a series of flags (questions you must answer in the Cyber Range by performing
                        ethical hacking activities on the target organization). New to CIEH v12, students will embark on
                        their first emulated ethical hacking engagement. This 4-phase engagement requires students to
                        think critically and test the knowledge and skills gained by capturing a series of flags in each
                        phase, demonstrating the live application of skills and abilities in a consequence-free
                        environment through EC-Council's new Cyber Range. As you complete your training and hands-on
                        labs, CIEH Engage lets you apply everything you have learned in a mock ethical hacking
                        engagement. This 4-part security engagement gives you a real ethical hacking engagement
                        experience from start to finish against an emulated organization. Using our
                        capture-the-flag-style range, you will complete your engagement by answering "flag" questions as
                        you progress.</p>

                      <p>The CIEH Global Challenges occur every month, providing capture-the-flag style competitions
                        that expose students to various new technologies and platforms, from web applications, OT, IoT,
                        SCADA, and ICS systems to cloud and hybrid environments. Our Compete structure lets ethical
                        hackers fight their way to the top of the leaderboard each month in these 4-hour curated CTFs.
                        Objective-based flags are designed around the ethical hacking process, keeping skills current,
                        testing critical thinking abilities, and covering the latest vulnerabilities and exploits as
                        they are discovered. Hosted 100% online in EC-Council's Cyber Range, candidates race the clock
                        in scenario-based engagements against fully developed network and application environments with
                        real operating systems, real networks, tools, and vulnerabilities to practice, engage, compete,
                        build, and hone their cyber skills against various new target organizations.</p>

                      <h4>How You Will Engage</h4>
                      <p>The CIEH V12 program helps you develop real-world experience in ethical hacking through the
                        hands-on CIEH practice environment. CIEH Engage equips you with the skills to prove that you
                        have what it takes to be a great ethical hacker. Your security assessment objectives will be
                        presented as a series of flags (questions you must answer in the Cyber Range by performing
                        ethical hacking activities on the target organization). New to CIEH v12, students will embark on
                        their first emulated ethical hacking engagement. This 4-phase engagement requires students to
                        think critically and test the knowledge and skills gained by capturing a series of flags in each
                        phase, demonstrating the live application of skills and abilities in a consequence-free
                        environment through EC-Council's new Cyber Range. As you complete your training and hands-on
                        labs, CIEH Engage lets you apply everything you have learned in a mock ethical hacking
                        engagement. This 4-part security engagement gives you a real ethical hacking engagement
                        experience from start to finish against an emulated organization. Using our
                        capture-the-flag-style range, you will complete your engagement by answering "flag" questions as
                        you progress.</p>

                      <p>The CIEH Global Challenges occur every month, providing capture-the-flag style competitions
                        that expose students to various new technologies and platforms, from web applications, OT, IoT,
                        SCADA, and ICS systems to cloud and hybrid environments. Our Compete structure lets ethical
                        hackers fight their way to the top of the leaderboard each month in these 4-hour curated CTFs.
                        Objective-based flags are designed around the ethical hacking process, keeping skills current,
                        testing critical thinking abilities, and covering the latest vulnerabilities and exploits as
                        they are discovered. Hosted 100% online in EC-Council's Cyber Range, candidates race the clock
                        in scenario-based engagements against fully developed network and application environments with
                        real operating systems, real networks, tools, and vulnerabilities to practice, engage, compete,
                        build, and hone their cyber skills against various new target organizations.</p>

                        techniques to bypass antivirus, launching fileless malware through script-based injection,
                        launching fileless malware through phishing, and more.
